# Kurero - Flutter

This repository contains a simple Flutter group chat application that utilizes the BLoC pattern for state management and follows the Clean Architecture principles. The application allows users to send and receive text messages in a group chat.

## Technology Stack
    - Flutter : A UI toolkit from Google for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.

    - BLoC - A state management pattern that helps manage the flow of data and events in Flutter applications.

    - Clean Architecture - An architectural pattern that promotes separation of concerns and maintainability by dividing the app into different layers.

## Functionality
    The application implements the following features:

    - Users can send and receive text messages in a group chat.
    - A default group named "Kurero" is available.
    - Default user accounts are provided (user1@kurero.com, user2@kurero.com, user3@kurero.com).

## Testing
    Comprehensive unit tests have been written to ensure the functionality and integrity of the code. These tests cover various aspects of the application, including the BLoC logic, data handling, and UI components and can be found in the `test/` folder.
